## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to analyse and improve the effectiveness of a digital marketing campaign by:
- Identifying key features influencing customer response
- Applying machine learning models to predict campaign outcomes
- Presenting visual insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboard creation
- **Orange ML** – for machine learning modelling (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, Random Forest)
- **Excel/CSV** – for data preprocessing and manipulation
- **MS Word/PowerPoint** – for report writing and presentation

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The following models were developed and tested using Orange ML:
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network
- Random Forest

All models were evaluated based on accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

Power BI dashboard includes:
- Customer demographics overview
- Campaign success rate visualisations
- Product and service response insights
